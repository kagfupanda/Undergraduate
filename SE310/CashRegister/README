1. JUnitLab3-Coverage.png has the screenshot of line and method coverage

Location of bugs:
--------
1. Drawer.java: Lines 51,52
  -- if random number generated is < 40 doesnot use the Billpack passed by caller
2. Drawer.java: Lines 120,121
  -- if random number generated is < 80, then defaults ones to 100, instead of using passed value
3. CoinPack.java line 59, is adding additional +5 to penny value passed.
4. added a comment below the buggy lines in this format:

0. The state abbreviation passed via the command line is used to determine location of the CashRegister.
  example: java -jar CashRegister.jar nj
will use NewJersey State to calculate its taxes.
  Available state abbreviations to use are: NY, NJ, DE, PA

1. The strategy pattern is used by using the specific state tax implementor class to pass in the constructor
to CashRegister. There are many constructors given, among which
 1. cr = new CashRegister(100,10,10,10,10,10,1000,100,100,10);
with no state tax passed, defaults to Pennsylvania and this is what is used to construct in case of default behavior.
 2. For state abbr passed in command line, following constructor is used:
  1. cr = new CashRegister(new BillPack(100,10,10,10,10,10),new CoinPack(1000,100,100,10),new NewJerseyTax());

--------
1. CashRegister.java is modified to return appropriate exception message, instead of generic "Sorry, purchase failed"
2. Then in Runner.java, the IllegalStateException is caught and handled for different messages
3. when tenedered cash is less than purchase items price, the program prompts the user
to enter a set of bills and coins to add, such that the items selected could be purchased.
  example: user is prompted to give more bills as a comma separated 1s,5s,10s, 20s, 50s, and 100s
[1,0,0,0,2,1] would mean user gave the following:
1x1s, 0x5s, 0x10s, 0x20s, 2x50s, 1x100s bills
  example: user is prompted to give more coins as a comma separated 1s,5s,10s,25s
[2,3,4,5] means 2x1s, 3x5s, 4x10s, 5x25s coins
4. The program prompts until user has given back enough cash to cover the total price of items he/she is purchasing.
